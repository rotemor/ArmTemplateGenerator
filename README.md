# Arm Template Generator
Generate and build Arm Template from code 

Iv been using ARM Templates and they can be a bitof a pain when you get to large scales
So im starting this Project to visualize and simplify building those templates 
 
This is a very first setp for a full ARM template generator with UI and maybe deployment 

At the moment I’m just spitting out JSON Arm template based on Class Model I’m creating 

Any help is welcome :)
